![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9889e53e-c262-4e16-a1cb-4ce3bcad561a)

This project is a result of the blockchain developer test assigned by **Nico Yudhanto** (<nico.yudhanto@anantla.com>) on **December 12, 2024**. The objective was to demonstrate blockchain development skills by completing the tasks listed in the test case. The project was completed on **December 15, 2024**, and update on **December 16, 2024** for final Result of the test.

---

## **Test Case**

### **Requirements**
1. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - Use Ethereum or another EVM-compatible blockchain.
   - Create a smart contract to handle token transfers (e.g., USDT/USDC).

2. **Stablecoin Support**:
   - Interact with testnet versions of USDT or USDC.
   - Implement a feature for a user to specify the amount and destination wallet address for the transfer.

3. **Fiat Conversion**:
   - Simulate fiat conversion rates (hardcoded or fetched from a mock API).
   - Show the equivalent fiat value of the transferred amount in the UI.

4. **Frontend**:
   - Build a simple React/Next.js interface to interact with the smart contract.
   - Include:
     - Wallet connection (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet).
     - Input fields for token amount, recipient address, and fiat equivalent.

5. **Backend (Optional)**:
   - Use Node.js/NestJS to manage fiat conversion logic and simulate API communication for rates.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the smart contract to a testnet (e.g., Goerli or Sepolia).
   - Host the frontend on a platform like Vercel or Netlify.

## **Project Deliverables**

### **Source Code**
- GitHub repository: [testbdkrakenteam](https://github.com/hendri2808/testbdkrakenteam)

### **Frontend Deployment**
- Hosted frontend on Netlify: [Kraken Team Demo](https://demokrakenteam.netlify.app/)

### **Smart Contract Deployment**
- In this update, we added **persistent storage** locally by using **Hardhat's deploy and deployment scripts**. This ensures that the deployment data remains available across sessions.

---

## **Project Details**

### **Tools and Technologies Used**
1. **Languages**:
   - Solidity: Smart contract development.
   - JavaScript/React.js: Frontend development.
   - Node.js: Backend integration.
   
2. **Frameworks**:
   - **Hardhat**: For compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts. Also used for forking Sepolia blockchain.
   - **Next.js**: For building the React-based frontend application.

3. **Dependencies**:
   - `ethers.js`: For interacting with Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
   - `@thirdweb-dev/react`: For MetaMask wallet integration.
   - `TailwindCSS`: For styling the user interface.
   - `coingecko-api`: Used for fetching the live USDT-to-USD conversion rate.

4. **Blockchain Environment**:
   - Local blockchain created using **Hardhat Forking** (forking Sepolia).

5. **Wallet**:
   - MetaMask was used for user wallet connection and transaction signing.

---

### **Challenges Faced**

1. **Testnet Deployment**:
   - Deploying the smart contract to Sepolia testnet was not possible due to the following reasons:
     - **Lack of Sepolia Faucet Tokens**: To deploy and interact with contracts on the Sepolia testnet, a minimum of 0.001 ETH is required in the wallet. Unfortunately, I did not have the required funds to obtain the tokens.
     - **Difficulty Accessing Faucet**: Attempts to obtain Sepolia ETH from public faucets and community requests were unsuccessful.
     - **No Immediate Support**: Despite reaching out to the community for help, no responses were received within the testing timeframe.

2. **Solution**:
   - To overcome this challenge and ensure smooth testing, **Hardhat Forking** was used to create a local environment by forking the Sepolia blockchain. This allowed me to:
     - Simulate real-world blockchain interactions.
     - Test smart contract deployments, token transfers, and user interface functionality without requiring actual ETH or access to the Sepolia testnet.

   While this approach was necessary under the circumstances, it ensured that all project requirements were met and thoroughly tested.

---

### **Features Implemented**
1. **Token Transfer**:
   - A smart contract (`MockERC20`) was developed to handle the token transfer functionality.
   - Users can specify:
     - Token amount.
     - Recipient wallet address.
   - Transactions are signed via MetaMask.

2. **Token to Fiat Conversion**:
   - The UI displays the equivalent USDC and USD value for the token balance.
   - Conversion assumes 1 MTK = 1 USDT for simplicity.

3. **Persistent Deployment**:
   - Deployment scripts were updated to ensure contract deployments are saved persistently in the local storage.

4. **Frontend Features**:
   - Wallet connection via MetaMask.
   - Input fields for:
     - Recipient address.
     - Amount to transfer.
   - Display of:
     - Token balance.
     - Equivalent fiat values in USDC and USD.

## **How to Run Locally**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hendri2808/testbdkrakenteam.git
   cd testbdkrakenteam
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies: Navigate to the frontend-dapp folder for the frontend**:

```bash
cd frontend-dapp
npm install
```

3. **Run the Project: Start all processes simultaneously**:

```bash
npm run start:all
```

4. **Mint Tokens: Run the minting script manually**:

```bash
npx hardhat run mintTokens.js --network localhost
Access the UI: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
```

---

## **Demo Application Flow**

1. **Start the application**:
```bash
npm run start:all
```

2. **Run the minting script**:
```bash
npx hardhat run mintTokens.js --network localhost
```

3. **Open the browser and visit**:
```arduino
http://localhost:3000
```

4. **Test features**:
- Connect Wallet using MetaMask.
- Fetch Token Balance.
- Execute token transfers.
- View balance converted to USDC and USD.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Updated Flow for Troubleshooting**:

1. **Run all services**:
```bash
npm run start:all
```

2. **Mint tokens: Run the script**:

```bash
npx hardhat run mintTokens.js --network localhost
```

3. **Access UI: Open the frontend**:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

4. **Verify the flow**:
- Connect Wallet.
- Fetch Balance.
- Test Token Transfer.
- Verify USD and USDC conversion.

5. **Deployment Notes**:
- Ensure ABI and contract addresses are updated in the frontend after redeployment.
- Update deployAddress.json and abis.js files if the contract address changes.

---

## **Conclusion**
This update introduces persistent storage for local deployments and streamlines the troubleshoot workflow. It ensures the development and testing flow is smooth, reliable, and replicable.

Cheers,
**Kraken (a.k.a Hendri)**
